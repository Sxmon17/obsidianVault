# Solar Cells
## How do they work
Solar cells convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels. This energy can be used to generate electricity or be stored in batteries or thermal storage.

When the sun shines onto a solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel. This energy creates electrical charges that move in response to an **internal electrical field in the cell**, causing electricity to flow.
